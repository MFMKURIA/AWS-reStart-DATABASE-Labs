#AWS 270-[DF]-Lab - Selecting Data from a Database

Check out my GitHub Repository - https://github.com/MFMKURIA/AWS-reStart-DATABASE-Labs

 Task 1: Connect to the Command Host

1. Access the AWS Management Console:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to Services > Compute > EC2.
   - In the left navigation pane, click on Instances.

2. Connect to the Command Host:
   - Find the instance labeled "Command Host".
   - Select the checkbox next to it and click Connect.
   - Choose the Session Manager tab.
   - Click Connect to open a terminal window.

3. Configure the Terminal:
   - Once the terminal window opens, execute the following commands:
     ```
     sudo su
     cd /home/ec2-user/
     ```

4. Connect to MySQL Database:
   - To connect to the MySQL database server, run:
     ```
     mysql -u root --password='re:St@rt!9'
     ```
   - Replace `'re:St@rt!9'` with your actual MySQL root password if different.

 Task 2: Query the world database

1. Show Existing Databases:
   - To verify available databases, run:
     ```
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```
   - Confirm that `world` database exists.

2. List All Rows and Columns in a Table:
   - Query all data from the `country` table:
     ```
     SELECT  FROM world.country;
     ```

3. Count the Number of Rows:
   - To count the number of rows in the `country` table:
     ```
     SELECT COUNT() FROM world.country;
     ```

4. Show Columns in a Table:
   - Display all columns in the `country` table to understand its structure:
     ```
     SHOW COLUMNS FROM world.country;
     ```

5. Query Specific Columns:
   - Select specific columns (`Name`, `Capital`, `Region`, `SurfaceArea`, `Population`) from the `country` table:
     ```
     SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population FROM world.country;
     ```

6. Order Data by a Column:
   - Order the query results by `Population` in ascending order:
     ```
     SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population FROM world.country ORDER BY Population;
     ```
   - To order in descending order, use:
     ```
     SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population FROM world.country ORDER BY Population DESC;
     ```

7. Use WHERE Clause for Conditions:
   - Filter data based on conditions (e.g., population greater than 50,000,000):
     ```
     SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population FROM world.country WHERE Population > 50000000;
     ```
   - Combine conditions using `AND` to refine queries:
     ```
     SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population FROM world.country WHERE Population > 50000000 AND Population < 100000000 ORDER BY Population DESC;
     ```

 Challenge (Optional)

- Query the country table:
  ```
  SELECT Name, Capital, Region, Population 
  FROM world.country 
  WHERE Region = 'Southern Europe' AND Population > 50000000;
  ```

 Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully:

- Used the SELECT statement to query a database.
- Used the COUNT() function to count rows.
- Utilized various database operators (`<`, `>`, `=`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `AND`) to filter and order data.
