#AWS 272-[DF]-Lab - Working with Functions

Check out my GitHub Repository - https://github.com/MFMKURIA/AWS-reStart-DATABASE-Labs

 Task 1: Connect to the Command Host

1. Access AWS Management Console:
   - Open your web browser and go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Log in with your credentials.

2. Navigate to Amazon EC2:
   - In the AWS Management Console, click on Services in the top left corner.
   - Under Compute, select EC2.

3. Locate and Connect to the Command Host:
   - In the left navigation pane, click on Instances.
   - Find the instance labeled Command Host.
   - Select the checkbox next to it and click Connect.

4. Connect using Session Manager:
   - In the Connect To Your Instance dialog, choose the Session Manager tab.
   - Click Connect to open a terminal window.

5. Configure the Terminal:
   - Once the terminal window opens, run the following commands to set up your environment:
     ```
     sudo su
     cd /home/ec2-user/
     ```

6. Connect to MySQL:
   - To connect to the MySQL database server, run the following command:
     ```
     mysql -u root --password='re:St@rt!9'
     ```
   - Replace `'re:St@rt!9'` with the actual password if it differs.

 Task 2: Query the world database

1. Show Databases:
   - First, verify that the `world` database exists by running:
     ```
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```
   - Ensure `world` is listed. Contact support if it's missing.

2. Review the Country Table:
   - View the structure and data in the `country` table:
     ```
     SELECT  FROM world.country;
     ```

3. Use of Aggregate Functions:
   - Aggregate functions operate on sets of rows and return a single value summarizing the data. Example:
     ```
     SELECT SUM(Population), AVG(Population), MAX(Population), MIN(Population), COUNT(Population)
     FROM world.country;
     ```

4. Splitting Strings with SUBSTRING_INDEX():
   - Use `SUBSTRING_INDEX()` to split strings based on a delimiter (like a space):
     ```
     SELECT Region, SUBSTRING_INDEX(Region, " ", 1) AS Region_Name_1
     FROM world.country;
     ```

5. Filtering with WHERE Clause and Functions:
   - Apply functions in the `WHERE` clause to filter data:
     ```
     SELECT Name, Region
     FROM world.country
     WHERE SUBSTRING_INDEX(Region, " ", 1) = "Southern";
     ```

6. Using LENGTH() and TRIM() Functions:
   - Determine string length and trim whitespace:
     ```
     SELECT Region
     FROM world.country
     WHERE LENGTH(TRIM(Region)) < 10;
     ```

7. Filtering Duplicates with DISTINCT():
   - Use `DISTINCT()` to retrieve unique values:
     ```
     SELECT DISTINCT(Region)
     FROM world.country
     WHERE LENGTH(TRIM(Region)) < 10;
     ```

 Challenge: Splitting Region Names

To split the region names `Micronesian/Caribbean` into two separate columns (`Region Name 1` and `Region Name 2`):

```sql
SELECT 
    SUBSTRING_INDEX(Region, "/", 1) AS Region_Name_1,
    SUBSTRING_INDEX(Region, "/", -1) AS Region_Name_2
FROM 
    world.country
WHERE 
    Region LIKE "%Micronesian/Caribbean%";
```

 Conclusion

You have now completed the lab assignment by using various SQL functions to query and manipulate data in the `world` database. Make sure to follow any additional instructions provided by your instructor or lab guidelines to successfully conclude the session.
