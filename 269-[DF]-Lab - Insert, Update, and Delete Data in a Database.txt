#AWS 269-[DF]-Lab - Insert, Update, and Delete Data in a Database

Check out my GitHub Repository - https://github.com/MFMKURIA/AWS-reStart-DATABASE-Labs

 Task 1: Connect to a Database

1. Access AWS Management Console:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the AWS Management Console.
   - Log in with your credentials.

2. Navigate to EC2 Instances:
   - Click on Services in the top-left corner of the console.
   - Under Compute, select EC2.
   - In the left navigation pane, click on Instances.

3. Connect to the Command Host:
   - Find the instance labeled Command Host in the list of instances.
   - Select the checkbox next to it and click Connect.
   - Choose the Session Manager tab and then click Connect to open a terminal window.

4. Configure Terminal:
   - Once the terminal window opens, run the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo su
     cd /home/ec2-user/
     ```
   - These commands switch to the root user and navigate to the home directory.

5. Connect to MySQL:
   - To connect to the MySQL database instance, run:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root --password='re:St@rt!9'
     ```
   - Replace `'re:St@rt!9'` with your actual MySQL password if different.

6. Verify Database Connection:
   - To list all existing databases, run:
     ```sql
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```
   - Ensure that you see the `world` database listed, which contains tables like `country`, `city`, and `countrylanguage`.

 Task 2: Insert Data into a Table

1. Insert Sample Data into `country` Table:
   - Check if the `country` table is empty:
     ```sql
     SELECT  FROM world.country;
     ```
   - It should return no rows if empty.

2. Insert Data:
   - Insert two rows into the `country` table:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO world.country VALUES ('IRL','Ireland','Europe','British Islands',70273.00,1921,3775100,76.8,75921.00,73132.00,'Ireland/Ã‰ire','Republic',1447,'IE');
     
     INSERT INTO world.country VALUES ('AUS','Australia','Oceania','Australia and New Zealand',7741220.00,1901,18886000,79.8,351182.00,392911.00,'Australia','Constitutional Monarchy, Federation',135,'AU');
     ```
   - Verify that the rows were inserted successfully:
     ```sql
     SELECT  FROM world.country;
     ```

 Task 3: Update Rows in a Table

1. Update Data in `country` Table:
   - Update the `Population` column for all rows:
     ```sql
     UPDATE world.country SET Population = 0;
     ```
   - Verify the update:
     ```sql
     SELECT  FROM world.country;
     ```

2. Update Multiple Columns:
   - Update `Population` and `SurfaceArea` columns for all rows:
     ```sql
     UPDATE world.country SET Population = 100, SurfaceArea = 100;
     ```
   - Verify the update:
     ```sql
     SELECT  FROM world.country;
     ```

 Task 4: Delete Rows from a Table

1. Delete Data from `country` Table:
   - Delete all rows from the `country` table:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM world.country;
     ```
   - Verify that the table is empty:
     ```sql
     SELECT  FROM world.country;
     ```

 Task 5: Import Data using an SQL File

1. Import Data from `world.sql`:
   - Exit the MySQL terminal:
     ```sql
     QUIT;
     ```
   - Verify the presence of `world.sql` file:
     ```bash
     ls /home/ec2-user/world.sql
     ```
   - Import data from `world.sql`:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root --password='re:St@rt!9' < /home/ec2-user/world.sql
     ```
   - Reconnect to MySQL:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root --password='re:St@rt!9'
     ```
   - Verify the import:
     ```sql
     USE world;
     SHOW TABLES;
     SELECT  FROM country;
     ```
   - Ensure data is imported into `country`, `city`, and `countrylanguage` tables.
